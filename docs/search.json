But the success of the initiative is under a lot of scrutiny.\nMore information can be found in this Texas Tribune guide.\n04/2025 UPDATE: Since the Trump administration’s return to office, Texas’ state government is working collaboratively with the federal government in its border security efforts, so the fate of Operation Lone Star is in transition.",

    "text": "Categorizing charges\nThe first thing we want to do is create categories for these charges. We won’t use them immediately to answer our demographics questions, but it will come in handy later when we look into each race and the charge breakdowns within them. We’ll also use them later to break down specific charge categories, like smuggling and drug arrests.\nWithin Operation Lone Star, there are 490 different types of charges. Therefore, we decided to break down the charges into 11 different categories. Here’s a key that describes each category.\nOperation Lone Star Charge Category Key:\n\nDrug: Any charge relating to the possession, manufacturing, storage, or sale of drugs. This category also includes “drug/weapon” offenses.\nWeapon: Any charge relating to possession/use of unauthorized firearms or weapons.\nWarrant/Conspiracy: Any charge relating to legal authorization of arrest or conspiracy to commit a crime.\nSmuggling/Trafficking of Persons: Any charge relating to human trafficking or smuggling. This category includes charges for smuggling both persons and firearms.\nTrespassing: Any charge relating to trespassing.\nImmigration Other: Any charge relating to immigration.\nEvasion/Fleeing: Any charge relating to evading or fleeing from authority.\nTampering: Any charge relating to tampering with evidence.\nOrganized Crime: Any charge relating to groups that engage in organized illegal activity (fraud, robbery, cargo theft).\nUnauthorized Use of Vehicle: Any charge relating to operating another person’s vehicle without their consent.\nMoney Laundering: Any charge relating to acquiring or concealing illegally obtained money.\n\n\nCreating categories\n\ncat_ols &lt;- olsdata |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    charge_cat = case_when(\n      str_detect(\n        charge,\n        \"Drug|CS|Cs|Mari|DRUG|MARI|Marj|MARJ|Man|Subs|Stash|Chem\"\n      ) ~ \"Drug\",\n      str_detect(\n        charge,\n        \"Smugg|SMUGG|Trafficking|TRAFFICKING|Trans|Bringing In\"\n      ) ~ \"Smuggling/Trafficking of Persons\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Firearm|FIREARM|gun|GUN|Amm|Arm|Weapon|WEAPON\") ~ \"Weapon\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Launder|LAUNDER\") ~ \"Money Laundering\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Trespass|TRESPASS\") ~ \"Trespassing\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Alien|ALIEN|Visa|VISA|IMMIGRATION|Immigration\") ~ \"Immigration Other\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Evad|EVAD|Flee|FLEE\") ~ \"Evasion/Fleeing\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Organized|Enterprise\") ~ \"Organized Crime\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Tamp|TAMP\") ~ \"Tampering\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Unauth\") ~ \"Unauthorized Use of Vehicle\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Warrant|WARRANT\") ~ \"Warrant\",\n      str_detect(charge, \"Conspiracy|CONSPIRACY\") ~ \"Conspiracy\"\n    ,\n    .default = \"Other\"\n  ))\n\ncat_ols |&gt;\n  count(charge_cat, charge)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThen we’ll do a quick group_by, summarize, arrange to see the categories and allow us to visualize it in a second.\n\ncat_chart &lt;- cat_ols |&gt; \n  group_by(charge_cat) |&gt; \n  summarise(charge_num = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(charge_num))\n\ncat_chart\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow that we’ve got that, let’s make a chart to visualize it. We’ll use ggplot, pull cat_chart back up, and create a simple bar chart. We reordered the bars so that the category is on the y axis so the readability is better. Then we adjusted the number labels so you can read them better and gave the bars a color. Now we can see which categories are the most prolific.\n\nggplot(cat_chart, aes(x = charge_num, y = reorder(charge_cat, charge_num))) +     \n  geom_col(fill = \"#0AB7F7\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = charge_num, hjust = ifelse(charge_num &gt; 1967, 1.1, -.1)),\n  color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n      title = \"What is Operation Lone Star Actually Doing?\",\n      x = \"Number of Charges\",\n      y = \"\",\n      subtitle = str_wrap(\"This chart looks at the different types of charges  under Operation Lone Star. Notably, the most popular type of charge is drug-related.\", width = 70),\n      caption = \"Source = Operation Lone Star Data\",\n      )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this simple chart, we can see a couple preliminary takeaways:\n\nAt least 23,233 charges under Operation Lone Star are drug-related.\nCategories like money laundering, tampering with evidence and unauthorized use of vehicle are more common than immigration related charges.\n\nNow that we have that for later, we’ll get into the demographics data.",

Then we made a column called drug_weapon for all charges under the drug category that could also be weapons charges.\nKey for Drug Categories:\n\nPoss Cs Pg: Possession of Controlled Substance in Penalty Group\nFentanyl: Group 1-B (any type of fentanyl)\nDrug schedule: Can refer to a group of drugs (for example, fentanyl can be found in schedule II drugs)\n1-A: LSD as well as any of its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers.\nOFFENSE: FALSIFICATION OF DRUG TEST RESULTS: Can refer to failing an authorized marijuana drug test Under Sec. 481.133., we noted that as “YES” under the marijuana column.\n\nLet’s count the amount of drug charges that can be related to fentanyl or marijuana:\n\ndrug_ols_analysis &lt;- drug_ols |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(drug_charge = case_when(\n    str_detect(fentanyl, \"YES\") ~ \"Fentanyl\",\n    str_detect(marijuana, \"YES\") ~ \"Marijuana\",\n    .default = \"Other\"   )) \n\ndrug_ols_analysis_new &lt;- drug_ols_analysis |&gt; count(drug_charge) |&gt; \n    rename(charge_count = n)\n\ndrug_ols_analysis_new\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThen we decided to make a simple bar graph to show the amount of charges that can be related to fentanyl or marijuana.\n\nggplot(drug_ols_analysis_new,\n  aes(x = charge_count, y =  drug_charge, fill = drug_charge)\n) +\n  geom_col(width = .6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = charge_count), \n            hjust = 1.2,\n            color = \"white\") +\n    labs(\n    title = \"What types of drugs does Operation Lone Star target?\",\n    x = \"Number of charges\",\n    y = \"Type of drug charge\",\n    subtitle = str_wrap(\"This analysis looked at fentanyl and marijuana related drug charges.

This is lower than the amount of charges related to marijuana, which are at least 9,491.\nOverall, fentanyl charges identified in this analysis account for little over 6% of all drug charges, while marijuana charges account for little over 40% of the drug charges (from the total 23,233 drug charges identified).\n\n\n\n\nSolo Drug Charges\nWhen talking to Lauren about the importance of drug charges within Operation Lone Star, she mentioned separating solo drug charges from the data set. To do this, we filtered and looked at single drug charges in order to look at what drugs were being associated to each charge. This helps us narrow down drug charges in the analysis.\nNow let’s look at the individuals being charged for drug charges:\n\ncat_ols |&gt;   filter(charge_cat == \"Drug\") |&gt;   count(charge_count)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nData Takeaways for Solo Charges\n\nMost charges are solo charges.\n\nNow let’s look at the solo charges and what drugs they are related too.\n\nsolo_drug_ols &lt;-\n  cat_ols |&gt;   group_by(charge, charge_count) |&gt;   filter(charge_cat == \"Drug\") |&gt; mutate(\n    fentanyl = case_when(\n      str_detect(charge, \"Fent|FENT|1-B|Schedule Ii/\") ~ \"YES\"),\n    marijuana = case_when(\n      str_detect(charge, \"Mari|MARI|Marj|MARJ|Drug Test|Schedule I/\") ~ \"YES\"),\n    default. = NA,) |&gt;\n  filter(charge_count == \"1\") \n\n\nsolo_drug_ols |&gt;\n  count(charge, charge_count, fentanyl, marijuana)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow we’ll group by what type of drug.\n\nsolo_drug_type &lt;-\n  solo_drug_ols |&gt;   ungroup() |&gt;   mutate(\n    drug_charge_s = case_when(\n      str_detect(fentanyl, \"YES\") ~ \"Fentanyl\",\n      str_detect(marijuana, \"YES\") ~ \"Marijuana\",\n      .default = \"Other\"\n    )\n  )\n\nsolo_drug_type_chart &lt;- solo_drug_type |&gt;   count(drug_charge_s) |&gt; \n  rename(charge_count = n)\n\nsolo_drug_type_chart\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow we’ll make a chart to look at this data.\n\nggplot(solo_drug_type_chart,\n  aes(x = charge_count, y =  drug_charge_s, fill = drug_charge_s)\n) +  \n  geom_col(width = .6) + \n  geom_text(aes(label = charge_count), \n            hjust = 1.3,\n            color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"What do solo drug charges look like under Operation Lone Star?\",\n    x = \"Number of charges\",\n    y = \"Type of drug charge\",\n    subtitle = str_wrap(\n      \"This analysis looked at fentanyl and marijuana related drug charges.

Those arrested tend to be males between late teenage to young adult ages (18-27). The most common type of charge across all races is drug-related.\nDrugs: The data itself is hard to read because the types of drugs and the way charges are documented isn’t consistent throughout time or programs. Therefore, among the drug charges we were able to categorize and identify, we can’t determine if the majority of those charges are fentanyl or marijuana related. However, there were instances where we were able to determine a specific drug, and in those cases, marijuana charges overwhelmingly surpassed fentanyl charges. The same was true for solo drug charges.\nPercentage Proportionality: Percentage-wise, most of the Black arrests in any specific county are on par with other races. Typically, Hispanic people are the most arrested in any county. Though some counties have percentages of Black arrests higher than 25%, the amount of people being arrested in those counties is so low that it doesn’t stand out. Additionally, when an officer has a high number of Black arrests, they have higher numbers of Hispanic arrests too, meaning Black people aren’t being singled out. Overall, the analysis doesn’t indicate that any officer or county is arresting more Black people than any other race.",

This data accounts for arrests made under Operation Lone Star starting in January 2023.\nHere is the summary of the differences between SPURS system and VERSA from the Depart of Public Safety Communications:\n“Please note that arrests are now documented on two spreadsheets due to the implementation of a new record management system in 2023 by the Texas Highway Patrol (THP). Prior to January 2023, THP utilized the Enterprise Management (EM) System for traffic enforcement activity (written warnings, citations, and CMV inspections) and SPURS for documenting entrusted property and criminal case reports. Beginning in January of 2023, THP underwent a statewide rollout of the Versaterm Software Suite, completed in August 2023, which serves as THP’s only RMS system for regular traffic enforcement activity, entrusted property, as well as general and arrest offense report entry.”\nMore information about Operation Lone Star is found in the index page of this website.\nThe data was obtained by a Public Records Request from KUT.",

    "text": "What did we find?\nOur final analysis page goes in depth on how we got to these conclusions, but here’s a breakdown of what we found for each category we looked into:\n\nDemographics: When it comes to the demographics of those arrested under Operation Lone Star, Hispanics are overwhelmingly the most arrested. Those arrested tend to be males between late teenage to young adult ages (18-27). The most common type of charge across all races is drug-related.\nDrugs: The data itself is hard to read because the types of drugs and the way charges are documented isn’t consistent throughout time or programs. Therefore, among the drug charges we were able to categorize and identify, we can’t determine if the majority of those charges are fentanyl or marijuana related. However, there were instances where we were able to determine a specific drug, and in those cases, marijuana charges overwhelmingly surpassed fentanyl charges. The same was true for solo drug charges.\nPercentage Proportionality: Percentage-wise, most of the Black arrests in any specific county are on par with other races. Typically, Hispanic people are the most arrested in any county. Though some counties have percentages of Black arrests higher than 25%, the amount of people being arrested in those counties is so low that it doesn’t stand out. Additionally, when an officer has a high number of Black arrests, they have higher numbers of Hispanic arrests too, meaning Black people aren’t being singled out. Overall, the analysis doesn’t indicate that any officer or county is arresting more Black people than any other race.",
